    "text": "Dear Prof. Burke, Hope this email finds you well. My name is Emilio Leguízamo and I am reaching out because I will be applying to the E-IPER PhD program at Stanford this fall, and I am very interested in joining your lab as a graduate student. I hold a BA and MA degree in Economics from Universidad de los Andes in Colombia and have research experience working as an RA at los Andes and in the Inter-American Bank, where I currently work.  I’m working under the supervision of Allen Blackman, mainly on research projects that estimate the effects of deforestation and pollution on health, productivity, and livelihoods in Latin America. I'm interested in joining the E-IPER program to further study how environmental changes that affect access to natural resources and ecosystem services impact poverty and inequality. To achieve this, I aim to use satellite and administrative data to investigate how factors such as income, gender, race, and location are related to environmental issues. My goal is to produce research papers and data products that can guide policy design for equitable natural resource management. I am enthusiastic about joining E-IPER's interdisciplinary program, as I believe it will provide me with a better understanding of the environmental factors that influence human decisions and welfare while maintaining a social science approach. Your work at the ECHOlab and SustainLab aligns very well with some of the questions I intend to address during my PhD, particularly those related to air pollution and the impact of climate change on health, livelihoods, and cognitive ability. I am eager to be a part of these labs and learn more about the cutting-edge methodologies you use to process satellite data and create products that measure economic development at a fine scale. I believe these data products are invaluable tools for uncovering the unequal effects of climate change that I hope to address in my research. As the application deadline approaches, I wanted to take the opportunity to introduce myself and inquire whether you will be accepting graduate students for the fall of 2024. Thank you for your time. I look forward to your response and any potential discussions about research ideas or opportunities. I'd be happy to share my CV and any additional information if you'd like to take a closer look at the projects I’m working on. All the best,",
